# Descrição

Essa mesa redonda propõe uma discussão sobre 2 artigos relevantes para a área de Visão Computacional e Deep Learning. Os artigos escolhidos são: 

* [The lottery ticket hypothesis: finding sparse, trainable neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635);
* [Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187). 

A mesa foi mediada por Jefferson e Paulo.

# Anotações

>The main idea behind MIT’s Lottery Ticket Hypothesis is that, consistently, a large neural network will contain a smaller subnetwork (the winning ticket) that, if trained from the start, will achieve a similar accuracy than the larger structure.
* The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: A randomly-initialized, dense neural network contains a subnetwork that is initialized such that — when trained in isolation — it can match the test accuracy of the original network after training for at most the same number of iterations.
